# **How to make Pepper Steak at home**

Start by slicing the steak thin then marinate in a mixture of soy sauce and granulated sugar while the other ingredients are prepped. For easy slicing, place the steak in the freezer for 15 â€“ 20 minutes to firm up the beef.

# **1. Prepare the marinade**

Mix together soy sauce and sugar and pour over the sliced steak. Marinate the beef for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.

# **2. Mix together the sauce ingredients**

In a small bowl combine the cornstarch beef broth and the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Whisk until blended and set aside.

# **3. Cook the beef**

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add half the beef and cook until browned around the edges. Turn the slices over and continue cooking for a few minutes more. Remove to a clean plate and keep warm covered with foil. Repeat with another tablespoon of oil and more sliced beef until all meat is browned.

Once quick fried, the steak is tender and flavorful with little crispy edges that I adore.

# **4. Stir fry the vegetables**

Next stir-fry the peppers and onions until crisp-tender. Reduce to medium heat and add the garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper flakes and sautÃ© quickly to round out the flavors.

# **5. Finish the dish**

Return the beef to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Add the beef broth mixture and cook until the sauce is thickened. Everything should now be coated in a simple but tasty sauce.

Finally, gently fold in ripe tomatoes at the end and heat slightly, just until warm but not cooked.

Serve over rice and enjoy!

# **Pepper Steak has been popular in the United States since the early 1950â€™s.**

Itâ€™s not an exaggeration to say that Iâ€™ve eaten this simple pepper recipe for at least 50 years. This was a go-to recipe my mom made on a regular basis feeding our little family of seven.

I have to admit as a kid I picked out all the peppers and tomatoes and just ate the meat. Haha â€“ but not now ðŸ™‚ Our son-in-law loves this recipe and even makes it occasionally with sliced boneless chicken breasts or boneless thighs.

I havenâ€™t tried this recipe with ground chicken or ground turkey but bet it would still be great!

# **Iâ€™ve made a few changes to my momâ€™s recipe over the years.**

- The original recipe called for twice the amount of soy sauce than I use now. I found this pepper steak recipe is better with less, but pass extra soy sauce when serving, for those who want more.
- Momâ€™s recipe calls for a slurry made with cornstarch, soy sauce and almost a cup of water. We now use low-sodium beef broth in place of the water for more beefy flavor in the sauce.
- Instead of adding garlic and ginger to the skillet before the vegetables, Iâ€™ve switched the order. It takes longer for the vegetables to cook so they go in first. Garlic and ginger only need about 1 minute to become fragrant, which is all they really need to bloom. I found that overcooking garlic and ginger can make the sauce bitter.
- And I added onions, because who doesnâ€™t love crisp-tender onions!
