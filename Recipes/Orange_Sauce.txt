Ingredients:
WATER: 1/3 cup
ORANGE JUICE: 1/2 cup
BROWN SUGAR: 1/3 cup
HONEY: 2 tbsp
RICE VINEGAR: 2 tbsp
SOY SAUCE: 1/4 cup
GARLIC: 2 piece
GINGER: 1 tbsp
OIL (OLIVE): 1 tsp
CORNSTARCH: 2 tbsp
WATER: 1 cup

Preparation:
First, you will start with fresh minced ginger and garlic. Not much, as we want the orange flavor to be the star of this sauce!

In a sauce pan, add 1 teaspoon of neutral flavored oil. 

Cook the minced garlic and ginger for around 2 – 3 minutes, until fragrant.

Next, add the orange juice, brown sugar, maple syrup, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Heat for 3 minutes. In a small bowl, make a slurry from 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and ¼ cup of water.
